# CheckLocks Analyzer

<!--* freshness: { owner: 'gvisor-eng' reviewed: '2020-10-05' } *-->

Checklocks is a nogo analyzer that at compile time uses Go's static analysis
tools to identify and flag cases where a field that is guarded by a mutex in the
same struct is accessed outside of a mutex lock.

The analyzer relies on explicit '// +checklocks:<mutex-name>' kind of
annotations to identify fields that should be checked for access.

Individual struct members may be protected by annotations that indicate how they
must be accessed. These annotations are of the form:

```go
type foo struct {
    mu sync.Mutex
    // +checklocks:mu
    bar int

    foo int  // No annotation on foo means its not guarded by mu.

    secondMu sync.Mutex

    // Multiple annotations indicate that both must be held but the
    // checker does not assert any lock ordering.
    // +checklocks:secondMu
    // +checklocks:mu
    foobar int
}
```

The checklocks annotation may also apply to functions. For example:

```go
// +checklocks:mu
func (f *foo) doThingLocked() { }
```

This will check that the "f.mu" is locked for any calls, where possible.

In case of functions which initialize structs that may have annotations one can
use the following annotation on the function to disable reporting by the lock
checker. The lock checker will still track any mutexes acquired or released but
won't report any failures for this function for unguarded field access.

```go
// +checklocks:ignore
func newXXX() *X {
...
}
```

***The checker treats both 'sync.Mutex' and 'sync.RWMutex' identically i.e as a
sync.Mutex. Which means that the checker does not distinguish between read locks
vs exclusive locks and treat all locks as exclusive locks***.

For cases the checker is able to correctly handle today please see the test file
here gvisor/tools/checklocks/test/test.go.

The checklocks check also flags any invalid annotations where the mutex
annotation refers either to something that is not a 'sync.Mutex' or
'sync.RWMutex' or where the field does not exist at all. This will prevent the
annotations from going stale overtime as fields are renamed etc.

# Explicitly Not Supported

1.  Checking for embedded mutexes as sync.Locker rather than directly as
    'sync.Mutex'. i.e The checker will not track mutex Lock/Unlock() methods
    where the mutex is behind an interface dispatch call.

An example that we won't handle is shown below

```go
type A struct {
  mu sync.Locker

  // +checklocks:mu
  x int
}

func abc() {
   mu sync.Mutex
   a := A{mu: &mu}
   a.x = 1 // This won't be flagged by copylocks checker.
}

```

1.  The checker will not support guards on anything other than the cases
    described above. For example, global variables/mutexes will not be checked
    for invalid access.

1.  The checker will not support checking for lock ordering violations. An
    example of what will not be flagged by the checker is shown below.

```go
type a A {
  mu sync.Mutex
  secondMu sync.Mutex

  // +checklocks:mu
  // +checklocks:secondMu
  // Preconditions: secondMu must be acquired only after mu is acquired.
  x int
}

func (a *A) doSomething() {
  // This code clearly violates the documented lock ordering by acquiring
  // 'a.secondMu' before 'a.mu' but this will not be flagged by checklocks
  // checker.
  a.secondMu.Lock()
  a.mu.Lock()
  a.x = 1
  a.mu.Unlock()
  a.secondMu.Unlock()
}

```

The tool explicitly avoids this because lock ordering if often a complex a
simple checker that did not do the right thing might actually lead readers to
incorrectly assume that the lock ordering was correct.
